JET Coding Task

Repo is containing 4 files:
- API: Information retrieval from API and storage
- read_json: store the data in a csv file for better access
- GUI: graphic user interface for the information in the csv file based on the postcode
- run.sh: bash file to run the files

Libs and Packages: request, csv, json, tkinter

To run the code, use command: bash run.sh, then enter the postcode without whitespace. It will show a list with 10 restaurants with their rating and a more info bottom. 
when you click on the more info, the name, address, rating and cuisines info is shown.

The code is not the most optimized version since it uses to intermediate files
